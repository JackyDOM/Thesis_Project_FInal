      "Okay, I need to figure out what the response should be for this medical question. The woman is 61 and has a long history of involuntary urine loss during activities but not at night. She's undergoing a gynecological exam and a Q-tip test. The question is about what cystometry would reveal regarding her residual volume and detrusor contractions.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let's think about the Q-tip test. The Q-tip is a dye that comes off when there's a leak. If it's not coming off, it might indicate a residual volume. But wait, sometimes the dye can stay if the leak is small. So maybe the Q-tip test is not showing a leakage, but the cystometry might.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cystometry measures residual volume and also looks for detrusor contractions. Residual volume is the amount of fluid that remains in the lungs. If the woman has a lot of urine, that suggests a large residual volume. Detrusor contractions are when the diaphragm contracts, causing gas to come out. If the woman has these contractions, it might indicate a small residual volume because the diaphragm is still contracting.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, she has a long history of involuntary urine loss, so she probably has a significant residual volume. The Q-tip test didn't show a leakage, which might mean she has a small residual volume. But the cystometry would combine both findings. If she has significant residual volume, cystometry might show a high residual volume. If she has small residual volume with detrusor contractions, it would show a low residual volume but indicate contractions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the question is about what cystometry would reveal. So if she has significant residual volume, cystometry would show that. But if she has small residual volume with contractions, it would show that. So depending on the findings, cystometry would either show high residual volume or low with contractions.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the question is asking what would cystometry reveal, so I think it's about both findings. Maybe she has both a significant residual volume and contractions. Or maybe she has significant residual volume but no contractions. Or maybe she has small residual volume with contractions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the question is asking what cystometry would reveal. So I think the answer depends on the findings. If she has significant residual volume and contractions, cystometry would show both. If she has small residual volume but no contractions, it would show small residual. But since she has a history of urine loss, she likely has significant residual volume.\n",
